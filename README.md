# It was necessary to implement:
- "in-hand card" object for CCG-like game
- loading card art randomly from https://picsum.photos/ each time app starts.
- use the arc pattern for displaying the cards 
- the card's UI with counter animation
- if the HP of any card drops below 1 - remove that card from the player's hand so that the other cards move with a smooth animation 
- player can drag a card and drop it on middle section of the table. Card moves back to player’s hand if it’s hasn't been dropped over the drop panel.
- cards shines when its being dragged.

**Took about seven hours**
